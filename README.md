# VBA-challenge-
This project required me to run a code that would loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

The ticker symbol. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. The total stock volume of the stock.

The project required us to use conditionals, variables, and a code to change the color of certain cells to indicate positive or negative change. This took days and a bunch of long nights. I used my macbook and it gave me a hard time every time i tried to run the script. After lots and lots of research I was able to figure out what the issue was and get it to run.

My project does not have a lot of commits because by the time I figured out how to do them most of the project was complete and I would have had to start all over. I was running low on time and I realize that I will have a lot of points deducted off because of that.
